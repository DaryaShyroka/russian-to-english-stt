### Data

Originally, when we planned to do Russian ASR, we planned to use the OpenSLR Russian LibriSpeech (RuLS) dataset to fine-tune an XLSR-Wav2Vec2 model. 
However, now that we are considering doing End-To-End Speech Translation using Fairseq, we might also use the CoVost dataset, which is 
a multilingual speech-to-text translation corpus from 11 languages into English. We would use the data for Russian speech to English text.
