### COLX 585: Trends in Computational Linguistics
#### Team Agreement
#### Team members: Dasha, Ali, Shreyas, Ladan 

All team members agree on the following terms and conditions:

1. **Work distribution**:

The work will be distributed in a fair and  equitable way between the members. We will decide on the work distribution during weekly team meetings and discussions. This will be in the agenda for the first meeting of the week which is going to be on Mondays at 2pm PST (with the duration of the meeting depending on the project need). Usually, "distributed in a fair and equitable way" will mean dividing the tasks based on the amount of marks for each task, so that each group member is responsible for the same amount of marks completed. It may also refer to the amount of time spent on each task, so that each group member is spending a similar amount of time. 
 
2. **Expected work hours**:

On average it is expected that each member of the team will spend 4-6 hrs (approximately) on the project weekly, but the exact amount of time will depend on the amount of work each week.
 
3. **Meeting schedule**:

- The meetings will be (tentatively) scheduled as follows:
   - a. Mondays (2:00-4:00 pm PST): discuss the plan for the coming week ;
   - b. Meeting with mentor;
   - c. Following up the mentor meeting and (optionally) a follow up discussion based on the mentor feedback;
   - d. Friday afternoon/Saturday mornings to finalize the weekly submission;
   
We will not have daily stand-up meetings because of time constraints. Instead, we will use short slack messages to update group members and/or ask questions. Team members will inform each other on the progress of the project. When an important part of the project is completed, we will use the `update` tag in our Slack message.
 
4. **Meeting agenda**:

On Mondays, we will discuss the plan for the week and distribute the work. On subsequent meetings, we will discuss any issues we have and update our team members on our progress. Important meeting points will be recorded in a written document.

5. **Meeting Technology**:

We will use Zoom or Slack to meet with group members. 
 
6. **Work style**:

Depending on the nature of the work, work might be done individually or via meetings when all or a part of the team members work together. Work might also be split into pairs in which the pairs can work together and update the other pair on their progress. This will all be agreed upon during Monday meetings.
 
7. **Quality of work**:

Every team member will put all their effort to create the highest quality of work. Team members will review each other's work and help identify typos in text and bugs in code. Team members might help each other edit, or debug their work, to ensure that we are submitting the highest quality of work possible.
 
8. **Availability**:

The team members are available from 8:00-5:00 PST Monday-Saturday, excluding lecture and lab times. This may change based on project needs or unexpected circumstances, in which case it will be communicated in advance. We will try our best to complete work before Sunday, however if needed, team members will be available to finish work on Sundays.

9. **Project Manager**:

We will not have a Project Manager for this project, and instead we will be entirely democratic throughout the project. We will make decisions together, and split up our responsibilities equally.
 
9. **Code of conduct**:
   - All team members will focus on what is best for the project.
   - All of us should participate in the project equally. 
   - We will communicate effectively, taking care not to offend others.
   - We will make sure to be respectful of others and their time.
   - We will make sure to actively participate in the project, and reply or react to Slack messages in the group channel within a reasonable timeframe.
